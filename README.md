# An (unofficial) FEMEN Android app

## Description

This is an Android project I started after contacting Inna if they would like to have FEMEN on Androids.

She said yes, but also that she had something other in mind.

Unfortunately I never heard of any other plans, so I'm releasing this into the wild as I don't have very much time to work on it any further.

## Features

Basically it's a compilation of different ressources you find on the
web:

* FEMEN.org
* Facebook account (which is shut down often and changes constantly)
* their Twitter
* their online shop
* their PayPal account (which never worked...)

It's working as an app though, maybe someone wants to develop this any
further or compilate it for themselves.

## Installation

1. [Download the apk here](https://github.com/aethyx/femen/releases) to your Droid
2. Install. Make sure you enabled "From unknown sources" in "Settings"
