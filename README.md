# An (unofficial) FEMEN Android app

## Description

This is an Android project I started after contacting Inna if they would like to have FEMEN on Androids.

She said yes, but also that she had something other in mind.

Unfortunately I never heard of any other plans, so I'm releasing this into the wild as I don't have very much time to work on it any further.

## Features

Basically it's a compilation (mixtape?) summed up in a free and neat app:

* FEMEN.org
* their Twitter account
* Facebook (Femen France)
* Official online shop
* PayPal for instant donations
* official Logos in use
* progress bar in Ukrainian colours

It's working, it's free, lightweight and can be copied to and SD card. Feel free to fork it and/or develop this any
further!

## Installation

1. [Download the apk here](https://github.com/aethyx/femen/releases) to your Droid
2. Make sure you enabled "From unknown sources" in "Settings"
3. Install.
4. Done. (-:
