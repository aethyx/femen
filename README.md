## Introduction

This is an Android project I started after contacting Inna mid-April 2014 if they would
like to have FEMEN on Androids.

She said yes, but also that she had something other in mind with their website femen.org.

Unfortunately I never heard of any other plans, so I'm releasing this
into the wild as I don't have very much time to work on it any further.

## Features

Basically it's a compilation of different ressources you find on the
web and summarizing them in an own Android app ecosystem:

* FEMEN.org
* a Facebook account (which is shut down often and changes constantly)
* their Twitter
* their Instagram
* their YouTube
* their Pinterest
* their online shop
* summarizing inside the app the different donation options
